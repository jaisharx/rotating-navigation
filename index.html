                    Docker containers provide a way to get a grip on software.
                    You can use Docker to wrap up an application in such a way
                    that its deployment and runtime issues—how to expose it on a
                    network, how to manage its use of storage and memory and
                    I/O, how to control access permissions—are handled outside
                    of the application itself, and in a way that is consistent
                    across all “containerized” apps. You can run your Docker
                    container on any OS-compatible host (Linux or Windows) that
                    has the Docker runtime installed.
                </p>

                    Docker offers many other benefits besides this handy
                    encapsulation, isolation, portability, and control. Docker
                    containers are small (megabytes). They start instantly. They
                    have their own built-in mechanisms for versioning and
                    component reuse. They can be easily shared via the public
                    Docker Hub or private repository.

                    Enterprise development work is notorious for being hidebound
                    and slow to react to change. Enterprise developers chafe
                    against such constraints all the time—the limitations
                    imposed on them by IT, the demands made of them by the
                    business at large. Docker and containers give developers
                    more of the freedom they crave, while at the same time
                    providing ways to build business apps that respond quickly
                    to changing business conditions.
