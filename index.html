You can use Docker to wrap up an application in such a way that its deployment and runtime issues—how to expose it on a network, how to manage its use of storage and memory and I/O, how to control access permissions—are handled outside of the application itself, and in a way that is consistent across all “containerized” apps. You can run your Docker container on any OS-compatible host (Linux or Windows) that has the Docker runtime installed. </p> <p> Docker offers many other benefits besides this handy encapsulation, isolation, portability, and control. Docker containers are small (megabytes). They start instantly. They have their own built-in mechanisms for versioning and component reuse. They can be easily shared via the public Docker Hub or private repository. </p> <h3>Before Docker containers</h3> <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598194501777-edbff942e501?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1050&q=80" alt="my dog"> <p> Enterprise development work is notorious for being hidebound and slow to react to change. Enterprise developers chafe against such constraints all the time—the limitations imposed on them by IT, the demands made of them by the business at large. Docker and containers give developers more of the freedom they crave, while at the same time providing ways to build business apps that respond quickly to changing business conditions. </p> <p> Docker offers many other benefits besides this handy encapsulation, isolation, portability, and control.
